# Hi, Megaventory staff 👋🏼

This is the repository for megaventory back-end developer internship attendance task.

## JavaScript

I've used JavaScript which is a multi-paradigm language. That's why OOP principles can be implemented using JavaScript.

## Packages Used (npm)

-   axios (I'm using Axios to create HTTP requests for API integration)
-   Dotenv (I'm using Dotenv to use environment variables such as API key)
